Non-Attentive, Superposed, Entangled, Expressive Representation


**Non-Attentive**: The model foregoes the traditional attention mechanism.

**Superposed**: Each token is represented as a weighted combination of multiple latent basis states.

**Entangled**: Tokens interact via symmetric, bidirectional updates, reinforcing mutual relationships.

**Expressive Representation**: The result is a rich, robust representation that captures complex, holistic relationships.
